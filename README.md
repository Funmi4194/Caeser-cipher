# CAESER CIPHER CODE IMPLEMENTATION
The Caesar cipher is an encryption technique used by Julius Caesar
to send communications that had military importance for his empire.
Today is a technique that is studied in Cryptography under the
classification of substitution ciphers, a topic that at the same time 
is under classic cryptography. It is also known as a shift cipher,
Caesar code or Caesar shift.


##Caeser Cipher Encrypt And Decrypt Using Go

Caeser Cipher code in the program is explicitly built inside the encrypt
decrypt packages

To make use of the available packages (encrypt and decrypt functions)
you have to import them into the main package 

import (
    "encrypt"
    "decrypt"
)
it points to the decode functions

## Main Function
 In the main function we call out the funtion declare in the packages and assign parameters to each of 
 the functionCall
